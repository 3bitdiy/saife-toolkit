    in the age of Big Tech and AI. The Manual is the culmination of a two-year Media &amp; Big Tech initiative
    that included a comprehensive analysis of existing policy approaches to media visibility, viability
    and vigilance. Developed through in-depth research and several expert roundtables, interviews, and
    broad consultations, it consolidates the expertise of more than 150 leading scholars and practitioners
    in media freedom, technology, and human rights from across the OSCE region and beyond. It is both
    a <b>practical tool and a call to action</b>, providing analysis, concrete recommendations, and
    principled guidance.</p> <h2 class="font-extrabold text-2xl leading-9 my-8">Main Findings and Recommendations</h2> <ol role="list" class="policy list-inside mb-4"><li>Big Tech platforms’ gatekeeping power determines what news is seen and heard.</li> <li>Concentrated control poses systemic risks for pluralism and democracy.</li> <li>Media visibility, viability, and vigilance (safety) are inherently interlinked.</li> <li>States have to respect, protect and fulfil media freedom – including through proactive policy
      measures.</li> <li>States are adopting policy interventions to create new privileges and protections for the
      media and journalists.</li> <li>The paradox of privilege: policy interventions can carry risks for media freedom.</li> <li>Policy interventions require robust rule of law safeguards.</li> <li>Mitigation is urgently needed, but safeguarding media freedom requires transformation in the
      form of structural change and sustained investment in healthy online information spaces.</li></ol> <h2 class="font-extrabold text-2xl leading-9 my-8">Need for short term mitigation measures and longer-term structural reforms</h2> <p class="mb-6">Given the many challenges facing the media with regard to Big Tech and AI, the Policy Manual
    offers a <b>toolbox of potential policy interventions</b> to ensure the availability and
    accessibility of public interest information and
    <b>foster a healthier online information ecosystem</b>. Building on in-depth analysis of
    existing initiatives and experiences as well as broad expert consultations, it provides
    <b>short-term practical mitigation measures</b>
    to strengthen media visibility, viability, and the safety of journalists online, while also calling
    for <b>longer-term</b> <b>structural changes</b> aimed at building resilient digital information
    spaces conducive to media freedom, peace, and security.</p> <p class="mb-6">While <b>short-term measures</b> are necessary to address current harms and challenges, the
    Policy Manual concludes that they alone are
    <b>not sufficient to overcome excessive concentration of power</b>
    and the control which tech platforms exert on the media. It thus suggests structural changes to support
    states in <b>transforming the current digital information environment</b> into a diverse, independent
    and resilient online information ecosystem designed to serve the public interest and promote media
    freedom, while reinforcing democratic processes.</p> <p class="mb-6">Acknowledging the diversity of legal systems and societal contexts across the OSCE, the Policy
    Manual does not prescribe a one-size-fits-all solution. The effectiveness and appropriateness of
    policy interventions depend on the specific political, legal and institutional context in which
    they are implemented. Hence, the Policy Manual underscores the need for policies to be <b>rooted in the rule of law</b>, adhere to <b>international human rights standards</b>, and be developed through
    <b>inclusive</b>, <b>transparent</b>, and <b>multi-stakeholder due diligence processes</b>.</p> <h2 class="font-extrabold text-2xl leading-9 my-8">Experts</h2> <p class="mb-2"><b>Authors</b> (in alphabetical order)<br/>
