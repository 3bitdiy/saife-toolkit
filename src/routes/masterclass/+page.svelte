    Part of the OSCE RFoM efforts to raise awareness among the OSCE participating States and
    non-state actors on the impact of AI-based content governance and surveillance-based business
    models of online platforms on the opinion-shaping process, freedom of expression, media
    pluralism, and democratic processes and to build capacity to address the challenges, in view of
    building a healthier online information ecosystem. The masterclass follows the OSCE Policy
    Manual produced within the course of the project Spotlight on Artificial Intelligence and
    Freedom of Expression (SAIFE). For more information, please get in touch via saife@osce.org.
