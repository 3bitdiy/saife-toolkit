  title="Case studies: How does AI put freedom of expression and media freedom at risk?"

    <p class="font-medium leading-5">
      Researchers, advocates, and journalists around the world are working to expose how AI systems
      are altering our information environments—and the risks and challenges this poses to online
      expression, media freedom, and other human rights.
    </p>

    <p class="font-medium leading-5 mt-4">
      The following case studies highlight key examples in which AI-driven content curation or
      moderation have been deployed by online platforms in ways that have limited or risked freedom
      of expression and access to information rights, which are necessary for the free exchange of
      ideas in democratic societies. Case studies also spotlight when violations to these rights
      cause or contribute to additional human rights risks or harms.
    </p>

    <p class="font-medium leading-5 mt-4">
      We note that a majority of these cases focus on the actions of a handful of U.S.-based
      platforms—Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube—and their policies and practices in various countries
      or jurisdictions around the world. This reflects the powerful footprint that just a few
      platforms have globally, which have in turn generated the bulk of media and academic
      attention.
